### The web and I

I started web development about a twelve years ago. Not knowing what I was really doing, just putting together bits and pieces to try everything out. Things were pretty basic back then, or at least for me. No frameworks, static content and no fancy stuff. Yet for some reason I still liked it. It had something to it that other areas of development, which I started to get involved with over the years simply didn't have in store. Not sure if it was the freedom you have in design, the ease of creating a pleasant user interface or just the simplicity of development.
