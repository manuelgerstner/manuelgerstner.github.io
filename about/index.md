## Info

My name: Manuel Gerstner


Full-time gypsy, avid software developer and cloud engineer, apprentice digital nomad! Having worked as an IT consultant for the last years, I have helped various of my clients shift towards a more modern and cloud-native approach to software development.


I am normally working on projects that last from about 3 to up to 6 months, but I am able to adjust accordingly in case the roadmap of your project differs.


My locations: [Munich, Germany](https://www.munich.travel/en-gb) / [Cape Town, South Africa](https://www.capetown.travel)
